Spring Boot
===========

In this tutorial we will build a Spring boot application from scratch

Also note that you can generate empty projects at https://start.spring.io/.

##1. Build a simple Spring Boot application

Follow the instructions at https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.5.9.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-first-application
to create your first Spring Boot application. Chapter 11.1 to 11.5

##2. Building a RESTful Web Service with Spring Boot Actuator

Use the tutorial at https://spring.io/guides/gs/actuator-service/ to create your more advanced Spring Boot application

##3. If you have time, convert your Spring application from 1-spring to Spring Boot

Now that you have built a Spring Boot application, try to convert the Spring MVC application you 
created previously to Spring Boot!
